# Feature Ideas

1) Add a visual indicator when a wezterm tab that is not currently the focus is waiting on user input.
2) Add a shortcut that adjusts the transparency of the editor.
3) Add a tiled window manager (TWM) for when multiple floating terminals are in the foreground.
4) Update the functionality so that for example, pressing ALT+i when you have other floating terminals in the foreground, even if the tmux floating terminal is already in the foreground, it brings it to the front of the foreground of all currently displayed floating terminals.
5) Continue developing the "Command Creator"
6) ALT+q is now functioning in tmux, but is not functioning as expected in other floating terminals that do not run tmux.
